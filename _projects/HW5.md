## Problem Definition
Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the support and actuator are rigid

## Constraints & Objectives
- Mechanism must stay inside 1500 mm × 500 mm
- Ground pins A and B are 300 mm apart
- Chosen bar lengths:
  - Main bar: 450 mm
  - Distance from A to C: 200 mm
- Actuator force limited to catalog **max force**
- Objective: maximize lifting force and vertical travel

## Degrees of Freedom
The mechanism has one degree of freedom.
